# Loan-Risk-Analysis-and-Prediction-A-Data-Driven-Approach-to-Credit-Efficiency-and-Risk-Mitigation

Introduction

	This project is part of a data-driven virtual internship program that aims to build predictive models with a data-driven approach. The main focus is to analyze historical datasets to generate deep insights and actionable insights that can support strategic decision making. In an era where data is an organization's primary asset, the ability to understand and process information into relevant predictions is crucial.

	This project is designed to explore loan data, identify significant patterns and trends, and develop predictive models that can be used by financial institutions. The results of this analysis are expected to help financial institutions reduce risk, improve the efficiency of the approval process, and provide a better customer experience.


About the Dataset

	The dataset used in this project is from the period 2007 to 2014, covering historical loan-related data. The dataset consists of 466,285 data rows and 74 attribute columns. The columns include important information such as:

Applicant Information: Includes data such as annual income, credit score, employment status, age, and education level. This information serves as a key indicator in assessing the borrower's risk profile.

Loan Details: Includes loan amount, interest rate, repayment status, loan duration, and loan type. This data provides insights into loan dynamics and repayment patterns.

Additional Data: Contains information such as geographic location, employment type, and other categories that can help with demographic analysis.

	However, this dataset also contains an “Unnamed” column that is not relevant to the analysis. To improve data quality, this column has been removed. In addition, the dataset was analyzed to identify missing values and outliers that could affect the analysis and prediction results.

 Key Insights

	Based on the initial exploration, some of the patterns that have been identified are:


Loan Distribution: The majority of loans are in the $5,000 to $15,000 range, with an average loan of $10,100. This range indicates general customer preferences and can be used for customer segmentation.

Relationship Between Variables: Significant relationships were found between interest rates, loan amounts, and repayment rates. For example, borrowers with interest rates above 15% have higher default rates compared to those with interest rates below 10%.

Outliers: Extreme values were found in some columns, such as annual income above $1,000,000, which could affect the results of the analysis. About 2% of the data contains these values, requiring special handling.

Demographic Trends: The 30-40 age group makes up the majority of borrowers, accounting for about 45% of the total dataset. Also, geographical locations such as California and New York dominate the loan demand, accounting for 15% and 12% of the total data respectively.

	Descriptive statistics and further visualizations will provide additional insights into the distribution of the data, relationships between variables, as well as areas that require special attention. This analysis will form the basis for building accurate predictive models.


Call to Action

	Through this project, the main objective is to provide data-driven recommendations for:


Improve Credit Efficiency: By predicting borrowers' likelihood of default based on their profiles, financial institutions can optimize lending strategies.

Identify Risky Segments: Assist financial institutions in setting more effective risk mitigation strategies, such as setting appropriate interest policies for risky segments.

Improve Loan Approval Process: By providing more accurate risk scores, financial institutions can speed up the approval process without compromising the quality of risk evaluation.

Support Strategic Decisions: Provide insights that can be used to formulate long-term policies regarding loan portfolios.


	As a next step, more in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted to validate the patterns and anomalies that have been discovered. In addition, predictive models will be built using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or other relevant algorithms. The final results of this project are expected to be implemented in the real world to support better data-driven decision making.
